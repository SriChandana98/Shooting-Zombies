## Game Objective - Survive the Zombie Apocalypse through Quick Thinking and Precise Shooting

In "Shooting Zombies," evading an unrelenting army of zombies is the primary goal. The only way to defend oneself from these advancing zombies is to respond to arbitrary questions while dispatching oncoming threats accurately. Your ability to blend quick reflexes, mobility tactics, and accurate shooting will determine how well you do in this game.

Here is how to achieve the goal:
### 1.Eliminate Zombies: 
The main objective is to shoot and kill the oncoming zombies before they get to you. The more quickly you can respond to inquiries and reload your weapon, the faster you can eliminate the zombies always moving towards you. Usually, a headshot will work!

### 2.Reload Your Gun: 
Hit the "r" button to reload your weapon. This is an essential activity since it gives you the means to continue fighting. Reloading presents a problem, though, and is not an easy task. Upon pressing "r," an arbitrary question appears.

### 3.Answer Correctly to Reload: 
You must correctly answer the random question to reload the gun and resume the action. This gives the game a fun and instructive twist while challenging your knowledge and mental acuity. If your response is accurate, your gun will load, and you can start shooting zombies.

### 4.Movement is Key: 
The "W," "A," "S," and "D" keys, as well as the arrow keys, can be used to move your character. You must make use of these controls in order to avoid danger and to open up better shooting possibilities.

### 5.Survival is the Goal: 
The ultimate goal is to survive as long as possible while avoiding waves of zombies. Your score will increase the longer you live, and the longer you repel the zombies.

In "Shooting Zombies," success requires quick reflexes, precise shooting and the capacity to think clearly under pressure and provide accurate answers to questions. It is an exciting and challenging game that rewards dexterity and mental quickness. Now load up your weapon, take on the zombie assault, and show everyone you can survive the end of the world!
